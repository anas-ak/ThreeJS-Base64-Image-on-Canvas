# ThreeJS-Base64-Image-on-Canvas
<p>
  Everything is in script.js <br />
  There are 3 main functions: 
  <ul>
    <li>getImageData(image)</li>
    <li>drawTheMap()</li>
    <li>init</li>
  </ul>
  Inside the getImageData function, we draw a canvas based on an image that's been turned into code. <br />
  Once all functions are defined, we create a new THREE scene with an OrthographicCamera, get the (canvas) image then draw the map (drawTheMap). <br />
